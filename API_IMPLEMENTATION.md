# API Key Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds a comprehensive API key management system to the Switch Game Repository, enabling users to integrate the downloader into their applications programmatically.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **api_keys collection**: Stores API keys with user associations, creation dates, and activity status
- **api_usage collection**: Logs all API requests with timestamps, endpoints, methods, status codes, and IP addresses
- Database methods for CRUD operations on API keys and usage logs

### 2. API Key Model (`app/models/api_key.py`)
- Secure API key generation using `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` (256-bit entropy)
- SHA-256 hashing for secure key storage
- Key verification methods
- Never stores plain-text API keys

### 3. User Control Panel Features
- **API Keys Management** (`/settings/api-keys`)
  - Generate new API keys with custom names
  - View all API keys (active and revoked)
  - Revoke API keys instantly
  - One-time display of generated keys (security best practice)
  - Link to API documentation

- **API Usage Statistics** (`/settings/api-usage`)
  - Total API calls counter
  - Usage breakdown by endpoint
  - Recent API calls with timestamps, methods, and status codes

### 4. Admin Control Panel Features
- **API Keys Management** (`/admincp/api-keys`)
  - View all user API keys across the system
  - See which user owns each key
  - Revoke any user's API key
  - Track last usage dates

- **API Usage Statistics** (`/admincp/api-usage`)
  - Overview of all users and their API call counts
  - Detailed per-user usage statistics
  - Recent API calls with IP addresses
  - Endpoint usage breakdown

### 5. API Authentication & Logging
- **Middleware-based Authentication** (`app/middleware/api_auth.py`)
  - Validates API keys from Authorization header (Bearer token) or query parameter
  - Automatic last-used timestamp updates
  - Rejects invalid or revoked keys
  - Tracks authenticated user for usage logging

- **Automatic Usage Logging**
  - Logs every API request
  - Captures: user_id, api_key_id, endpoint, method, status_code, IP address, timestamp
  - Non-blocking async logging

### 6. API Documentation Page (`/api-docs`)
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Getting started guide with API key setup instructions
- Authentication methods (Bearer token and query parameter)
- Detailed endpoint documentation
  - GET /api/list - List all game entries
  - GET /api/download/{entry_id} - Download specific entry
- Code examples in multiple languages:
  - Python (using requests library)
  - JavaScript/Node.js (using axios)
  - cURL (command-line)
- Error codes reference
- Rate limits information
- Support links

### 7. UI Integration
- Link to API documentation on the index dashboard
- API Keys section added to user settings
- Admin dashboard cards for API management
- Consistent styling with existing UI

## Security Features

1. **Secure Key Generation**
   - Uses cryptographically secure random number generator
   - 256-bit entropy (43 characters base64url)

2. **Hash-based Storage**
   - API keys hashed with SHA-256 before storage
   - Plain-text keys never stored in database
   - Keys only shown once at generation time

3. **Revocation Support**
   - Instant key revocation
   - Revoked keys immediately rejected
   - No grace period for compromised keys

4. **Usage Tracking**
   - Complete audit trail of API usage
   - IP address logging for security monitoring
   - Per-user and per-key statistics

5. **Authentication Validation**
   - Middleware validates every API request
   - Returns appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Prevents unauthorized access

## Testing Results

### Unit Tests
- ✅ API key generation works correctly
- ✅ API key hashing produces 64-character SHA-256 hash
- ✅ API key verification validates correctly
- ✅ Invalid keys are rejected

### Code Review
- ✅ No review comments found
- ✅ Code follows repository patterns

### Security Scan (CodeQL)
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities detected
- ✅ No alerts found in Python analysis

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Log in to your account
2. Go to Settings → API Keys
3. Click "Generate API Key" and provide a name
4. Copy the displayed key (shown only once)
5. Use the key in your application with Authorization header or query parameter
6. Monitor usage in Settings → API Usage

### For Administrators
1. Access Admin CP
2. Navigate to "API Key Management" to view/revoke keys
3. Navigate to "API Usage Statistics" to monitor usage
4. Click on usernames to view detailed usage

### For Developers
1. Visit `/api-docs` for comprehensive API documentation
2. Generate an API key from your account settings
3. Use the key in your requests:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" https://your-site.com/api/list
   ```
4. View code examples in Python, JavaScript, and cURL

## Performance Considerations

- API key lookup uses hash-based indexing (O(1) average)
- Usage logging is async and non-blocking
- Last-used timestamp updates don't block request processing
- Middleware only processes /api/* endpoints

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

Potential future additions:
- Rate limiting per API key
- Scoped API keys (read-only vs full access)
- API key expiration dates
- Webhook support for API events
- API usage analytics dashboard
- Export usage data to CSV

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready API key management system that:
- Enables third-party integrations
- Maintains security best practices
- Provides comprehensive usage tracking
- Offers excellent user and admin experiences
- Integrates seamlessly with existing codebase
